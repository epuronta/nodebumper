Multiplayer game implemented with Node.js server, WebSocket and client side canvas graphics.

Game has X players on a playing area, controlling discs with thrusters up, down, left and right. Players
control thruster power to push other players out of the area.

This is not a serious project. It is meant mainly to test out server side JavaScript out of curiosity
and also get some material for Bachelor's thesis.
